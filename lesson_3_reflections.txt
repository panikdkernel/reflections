When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-when having multiple people contributing to the project 
-backing up
-using different computer to add changes


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

maybe if we know that the remote repo is broken and we dont want and if set automatically it might break your local repo too.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

this helps letting the online repo know from which point to add commits in the online repo. also helps us letting know that if we are ahead of the online repo.
