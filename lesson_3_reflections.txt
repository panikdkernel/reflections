When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-when having multiple people contributing to the project 
-backing up
-using different computer to add changes


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

maybe if we know that the remote repo is broken and we dont want and if set automatically it might break your local repo too.
