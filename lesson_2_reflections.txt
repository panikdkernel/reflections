What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

after you run 'git init' a new reporistory is created for that particular directory. this is done because we need to track the files of that directory. (git status, git init) 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

working directory has all untracked files.staging area acts as a intermediate stage before changes are commited to git repository and also tells git to start tracking it.(git add filename, git reset)
